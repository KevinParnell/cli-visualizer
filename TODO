- improve reading from alsa
    -probably involves using the alsa api directly

- add direct mac os x support
    -involves hooking into CoreAudio probably with AVAudioSession  https://github.com/syedhali/EZAudio/blob/master/EZAudio/EZAudioDevice.m

- use configure or something similar to check for libraries and which compiler to use and flags

- add windows support
    - probably just ncurses through cygwin
    - audio source would be some windows api
    - use define guards everywhere there are *nix dependent includes
